    "Summarization is an important task in natural language processing and could be useful for a consumer enterprise. For example, bots can be used to scrape articles, summarize them, and then you can use sentiment analysis to identify the sentiment about certain stocks. Anyways who wants to read an article or a long email today, when you can build a transformer to summarize text for you. Let's get started, by completing this assignment you will learn to:  \n",

    "- Evaluate your model\n",

But now four students at Riverhead High School on Long Island, New York, have been suspended for dropping to a knee and taking up a prayer pose to mimic Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow.
